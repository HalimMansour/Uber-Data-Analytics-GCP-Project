# Uber Data Analytics | GCP Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Uber Data Analytics project, where we leverage the power of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to perform insightful data analytics on Uber data. This project utilizes a combination of GCP services, including GCP Storage, Python, Compute Instance, BigQuery, and Looker Studio, to extract valuable information from the data.

## Architecture

### Modern Data Pipeline Tool
We use Mage Data Pipeline Tool, an advanced data pipeline tool developed by Mage AI, to streamline the data processing pipeline. Learn more about Mage AI and contribute to their open source project on GitHub: [Mage AI GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai)

## Dataset

For this project, we utilize the TLC Trip Record Data, which includes both yellow and green taxi trip records. The dataset captures various fields such as pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, trip distances, fares, rate types, payment types, and passenger counts, as reported by the drivers.

You can find more information about the dataset using the following resources:
